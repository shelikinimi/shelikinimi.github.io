            located in the town of Dimapur in Nagaland.
            The ruins are a series of mushroom domed pillars that were created by the Dimasa
            Kachari Kingdoms that ruled before the Ahom invasion during the 13th century.
            The purpose and origin of the pillars are mysterious; few of the pillars
            stand in full glory while others are crumbled down.It is also believed that a
            game similar to that of chess was played here with the mushroom shaped
            dooms. It is a glory of the North East and the tourism department of Nagaland.
