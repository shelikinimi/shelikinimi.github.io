          Kachari Ruins or The Dimasa Kachari Ruins is located in the town of
          Dimapur in Nagaland. The ruins are a series of mushroom domed pillars
          that were created by the Dimasa Kachari Kingdoms that ruled before the
          Ahom invasion during the 13th century. The purpose and origin of the
          pillars are mysterious; few of the pillars stand in full glory while
          others are crumbled down. It is also believed that a game similar to
          that of chess was played here with the mushroom shaped dooms. It is a
          glory of the North East and the tourism department of Nagaland.
